on the lab website.

## Fireflies

> A. Insert an R code chunk and create a graph depicting the frequency
> distribution of the 35 mass measurements. It should have legible text
> and appropriate axis labels.

ggplot(data = fireflies\_data) + geom\_histogram(mapping = aes(x =
spermatophoreMass), binwidth = .005,

``` 
            fill = "#C5351B", color = "black") +
```

labs(x = “spermatophoreMass”, y = “Frequency (number of fireflies)”) +

theme\_classic() + theme( axis.title = element\_text(face = “bold”),
axis.text = element\_text(color = “black”, size = rel(1)) )

> B. What type of graph did you choose in part (A)? Why?

I chose a histogram. The reason I chose this type of graph is because it
groups the numbers in to ranges.

> C. Describe the shape of the frequency distribution. What are its main
> features?

The shape is unimodal skewing right. There is a major clump at the
beginning between 0 and 0.10 and a small clump at the end.

> D. What term would be used to describe the largest measurement in the
> frequency distribution? You can refer to the lecture slides, your
> notes, or the textbook.

Median

## Bird orders

I read the data using the code provided by the instructor. The dataset
is from the auk package and was originally named ebird\_taxonomy. I
converted it to a tibble, removed non-species taxa, and named the new
dataset birds.

    library(auk)                          # load the auk package
    birds <- ebird_taxonomy %>%           # start with the ebird_taxonomy data
      as_tibble() %>%                     # tibbles print better in the console
      filter(category == "species")       # remove non-species taxa

> E. How many bird species are in the new birds dataset? How did you
> find out?

There are 16,513 bird species in the dataset. When I created the data
set it showed 16,513 rows. Meaning that there are 16,513 birds species.

> H. How many orders are there? You can get this right by counting on
> the graph, but you will only get full points if you use some code to
> figure it out.

There are 41 orders. When I examined the data I had a graph that showed
41 lines when I ws looking at the orders.

> F. Insert an R code chunk and create a graph depicting the
> distribution of orders in the birds dataset. Sort the orders with the
> most frequent on the left. It should have legible text and appropriate
> axis labels.

ggplot(data = ebird\_taxonomy) + geom\_bar(mapping = aes(x =
fct\_infreq(order)), fill = “\#C5351B”, width = .8) + labs(x = “Order”,
y = “Frequency (log number of bird species)”, title = “Number of bird
species in each order”) + scale\_y\_log10() + theme\_classic(base\_size
= 12) + theme( axis.title = element\_text(face = “bold”), axis.text =
element\_text(color = “black”, size = rel(.8)), axis.text.x =
element\_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), axis.ticks.x = element\_blank() )

> G. What kind of graph did you create? Why?

I created a bar graph. I did this because we were creating graphs of
categorical data, which is easiest depicted on a bar graph.
